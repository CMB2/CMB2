## Description

CMB2 is a developer's toolkit for building metaboxes, custom fields, and forms for WordPress that will blow your mind.

**[Download plugin on wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/)**

CMB2 is a complete rewrite of [Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress). To get started, please follow the examples in the included `example-functions.php` file and have a look at the [basic usage instructions](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Basic-Usage).

You can see a list of available field types [here](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Field-Types#types).

## Features:

* Create metaboxes to be used on post edit screens.
* [Create forms to be used on an options pages](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Using-CMB-to-create-an-Admin-Theme-Options-Page).
* Create forms to handle user meta and display them on user profile add/edit pages.
* [Flexible API that allows you to use CMB forms almost anywhere, even on the front-end](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Bringing-Metaboxes-to-the-Front-end).
* [Several field types are included](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Field-Types).
* [Custom API hook that allows you to create your own field types](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Adding-your-own-field-types).
* There are numerous hooks and filters, allowing you to modify many aspects of the library (without editing it directly).
* Repeatable fields for most field types are supported, as well as repeatable field groups.
* CMB2 is safe to bundle with any project. It will only load the newest version in the system.

## Translation
* Thanks to many in the CMB2 community and to our friends at [wp-translations.org](http://wp-translations.org/project/cmb2/), we have a good start on several translations for CMB2. Please feel free to [work with wp-translations.org](http://wp-translations.org/project/cmb2/) to provide even more!

* [CMB2 Field Type: Google Maps](https://github.com/mustardBees/cmb_field_map) from [mustardBees](https://github.com/mustardBees): Custom field type for Google Maps.
	> The `pw_map` field stores the latitude/longitude values which you can then use to display a map in your theme.

* [CMB2 Field Type: Select2](https://github.com/mustardBees/cmb-field-select2) from [mustardBees](https://github.com/mustardBees): Custom field types which use the [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/) script:

	> 1. The `pw_select field` acts much like the default select field. However, it adds typeahead-style search allowing you to quickly make a selection from a large list
	> 2. The `pw_multiselect` field allows you to select multiple values with typeahead-style search. The values can be dragged and dropped to reorder

* [CMB Field Type: Slider](https://github.com/qmatt/cmb2-field-slider) from [mattkrupnik](https://github.com/mattkrupnik/): Adds a jQuery UI Slider field.
* [WDS CMB2 Date Range Field](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2-Date-Range-Field) from [dustyf](https://github.com/dustyf) of [WebDevStudios](https://github.com/WebDevStudios): Adds a date range field.
* [CMB2 Remote Image Select](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2-Remote-Image-Select-Field) from [JayWood](https://github.com/JayWood) of [WebDevStudios](https://github.com/WebDevStudios): Allows users to enter a URL in a text field and select a single image for use in post meta.

* [CMB Field Type: Tags](https://github.com/florianbeck/cmb2-field-type-tags): WordPress-Tags-like field type for CMB2. _note: this does not set the post tags, but simply provides a unique text input_
* [CMB2 Term Select](https://github.com/florianbeck/cmb2-field-type-tags): Special CMB2 Field that allows users to define an autocomplete text field for terms. _Note: this will set the taxonomy terms, but has the option (`'apply_term' => false`) to disable and save the term ids as data instead (like for options pages, etc)._
* [CMB2 Related Links](https://github.com/jtsternberg/CMB2-Related-Links): Allows users to add a related links via a repeating field group. Field inputs are powered by the [CMB2 Field Type: CMB2 Post Search field](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2-Post-Search-field) documented above, and so each link can be populated with existing WordPress content by clicking on the search button. _Note: this is not a standard field type, but instead a function you use in combination with CMB2::add_field()._

4. Profit.

## Most Recent Changes

### 2.2.1 - 2016-02-29

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes back-compatibility issue which could allow multiple CMB2 instances to load (causing fatal errors). ([#520](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/520))

### 2.2.0

#### Enhancements

* Term Meta! As of WordPress 4.4, [WordPress will have the ability to use term metadata](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/23/4-4-taxonomy-roundup/). CMB2 will work with term meta out of the box. To do so, see the example cmb registration in the `yourprefix_register_taxonomy_metabox` function in [example-functions.php](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/blob/master/example-functions.php).
* New hooks which hook in after save field action: `'cmb2_save_field'` and `"cmb2_save_field_{$field_id}"`. Props [wpsmith](https://github.com/wpsmith) ([#475](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/475)).
* The "cmb2_sanitize_{$field_type}" hook now runs for every field type (not just custom types) so you can override the sanitization for all field types via a filter.
* `CMB2::show_form()` is now composed of 3 smaller methods, `CMB2::render_form_open()`, `CMB2::render_field()`, `CMB2::render_form_close()` ([#506](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/506)).
* RTL Style generated. Props [@devinsays](https://github.com/devinsays) ([#510](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/510)).
* Properly scope date/time-pickers styling by adding a class to only cmb2 picker instances. ([#527](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/527))
* Allow per-field overrides for the date/time/color picker options (wiki documentation: [Modify Field Date, Time, or Color Picker options](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Tips-&-Tricks#modify-field-date-time-or-color-picker-options))
* Fix some inline documentation issues. Props [@jrfnl](https://github.com/jrfnl) ([#579](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/579)).
* Include `.gitattributes` file for excluding development resources when using Composer. Props [@benoitchantre](https://github.com/benoitchantre) ([#575](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/575), [#53](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/53)).

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue with `'taxonomy_select'` field type where a term which evaluated falsey would not be displayed properly. Props [adamcapriola](https://github.com/adamcapriola) ([#477](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/477)).
* Fix issue with colorpickers not changing when sorting groups.
* `'show_option_none'` field parameter now works on taxonomy fields when explicitly setting to false.
* Fix so the date/time-picker javascript respects the `'date_format'` and `'time_format'` field parameters. Props [@yivi](https://github.com/yivi) ([#39](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/39), [#282](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/282), [#300](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/300), [#318](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/318), [#330](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/330), [#446](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/446), [#498](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/498)).
* Fix a sometimes-broken unit test. Props [JPry](https://github.com/JPry) ([#539](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/539)).
* Fix issue with oembed fields not working correctly on options pages. ([#542](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/pull/542)).
