## Description

CMB2 is a developer's toolkit for building metaboxes, custom fields, and forms for WordPress that will blow your mind. Easily manage meta for posts, terms, users, comments, or create custom option pages.

**[Download plugin on wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/)**

CMB2 is a complete rewrite of [Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress). To get started, please follow the examples in the included `example-functions.php` file and have a look at the [basic usage instructions](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/wiki/Basic-Usage).

You can see a list of available field types [here](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/wiki/Field-Types#types).

If you are coming from the original "Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress" plugin, [please read this post](https://webdevstudios.com/2015/02/02/cmb2-wordpress-plugin/) for the CMB2 background story.
