# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Enhancements

* With 2.3.0, will be fully switching to the more communicative and standard [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). ([#1061](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/1061)).
* Updated Italian translation. Props [@Mte90](https://github.com/Mte90) ([#1067](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/1067)).

### Bug Fixes

## [2.2.6.2 - 2017-11-24](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/releases/tag/v2.2.6.2)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix another issue (introduced in 2.2.6) with repeatable fields not being able to save additional fields. Props [@anhskohbo](https://github.com/anhskohbo) ([#1059](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/1059), [#1058](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/1058)).
* Only dequeue `jw-cmb2-rgba-picker-js` script (and enqueue our `wp-color-picker-alpha`) if it is actually found.

## [2.2.6.1 - 2017-11-24](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/releases/tag/v2.2.6.1)

### Enhancements

* Merge in the [CMB2 RGBa Colorpicker](https://github.com/JayWood/CMB2_RGBa_Picker) field type functionality to the CMB2 colopicker field type. Adds the ability to add an alpha (transparency) slider to the colorpicker by adding the `'alpha'` option [to the field options array](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/blob/6fce2e7ba8f41345a23bc2064e30433bdb11c16c/example-functions.php#L263-L265). Thank you to [JayWood](https://github.com/JayWood) for his work on his custom field type. 

### Bug Fixes

* Fix issue (introduced in 2.2.6) with complex fields set as repeatable not being able to save additional fields. Fixes [#1054](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/1054).

## [2.2.6 - 2017-11-14](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/releases/tag/v2.2.6)

### Enhancements

* Move the fetching of group label and description to _after_ calling `'before_group'` parameter.
* Allow using the `'render_row_cb'` param for group fields. Fixes [#1041](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/1041).
* Allow resetting cached CMB2 field objects (new 3rd parameter to `CMB2::get_field()`).
* Allow resetting cached callback results (`CMB2_Base::unset_param_callback_cache()`).
* Persian translation provided by [@reza-irdev](https://github.com/reza-irdev) ([#1046](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/1046)).
* Added a `'message_cb'` box property, which allows defining a custom callback for adding options-save messages on `options-page` boxes. An example has been added to [example-functions.php](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/commit/43d513c135e52c327bafa06309821c29323ae2dd#diff-378c74d0ffffc1759b8779a135476777).
* Updated many the oembed-related unit tests to more reliably test the relevant parts, and not so much the actual success of the WordPress functions.
* Updated travis config to Install PHP5.2/5.3 on trusty for unit tests. Stolen from [gutenberg/pull/2049](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2049). Intended to compensate for Travis removing support for PHP 5.2/5.3.

### Bug Fixes

* Ensure `'file'` field type ID is removed from the database if the `'file'` field type's value is empty ([Support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/bug-field-of-type-file-does-not-delete-postmeta-properly/)).
* Fix JS errors when `user_can_richedit()` is false ("Disable the visual editor when writing" user option is checked, or various unsupported browsers). See [#1031](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/1031).
* Fix issue where some European date formats (e.g. `F j, Y`) would not properly translate into jQuery UI date formats. [Support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/using-wordpresss-date-time-format-settings)
* Fix repeating fields within repeating groups having the values/indexes incorrectly associated. Props [@daggerhart](https://github.com/daggerhart) ([#1047](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/1047)). Fixes [#1035](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/1035), [#348](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/348).
* Fixed multiple update messages on settings pages when CMB2 option pages were registered ([#1049](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/1049)).
* Fix issue where using multiple oembed fields could cause incorrectly cached arguments to be used.
* Fix bug where `'select_all_button' => false` was not working for `'taxonomy_multicheck'` field type ([#1005](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/1005)).

## [2.2.5.3 - 2017-08-22](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/releases/tag/v2.2.5.3)

### Enhancements

* Update to instead initate CMB2 hookup via `"cmb2_init_hookup_{$cmb_id}"` hook. Allows plugins to unhook/rehook/etc.

### Bug Fixes

* Spelling/Grammar fixes. Props [@garrett-eclipse](https://github.com/garrett-eclipse) ([#1012](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/1012)).
* Fix "PHP Strict Standards: Static function should not be abstract" notice.
* Add `CMB2_Utils::normalize_if_numeric()` to address problems when using floats as select/radio values. Fixes [#869](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/869). See [#1013](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/1013).
* Fix issues with apostrophes in money values. (e.g. in Swiss German the thousand separator is an apostrophe). Props [@ocean90](https://github.com/ocean90) ([#1014](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/1014), [#1015](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/1015)).
* Provide public access to the `CMB2_Options_Hookup::$option_key` property.
* Change the updated-settings notice query variable so that WordPress does not auto-add settings notices on top of ours.
* For settings pages, only output settings errors if WordPress does not do it by default (for sub-pages of `options-general.php`), and if the errors are not disabled via the `'disable_settings_errors'` box property.

## [2.2.5.2 - 2017-08-08](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/releases/tag/v2.2.5.2)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix issue in 2.2.5 with non-sortable repeatable groups not having new groups values be emptied on creation/clone. [Support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/the-default-parameter-dont-work-in-group-fields/page/2/)
* Fix issue in 2.2.5 with options pages not saving when `'parent_slug'` box property was used. Fixes [#1008](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/1008).

## [2.2.5.1 - 2017-08-07](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/releases/tag/v2.2.5.1)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix issue in 2.2.5 which caused empty repeatable groups having the buttons set to have a disabled "Remove Group" button. [Support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/the-default-parameter-dont-work-in-group-fields/)

## [2.2.5 - 2017-08-07](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/releases/tag/v2.2.5)

### Enhancements

* Options pages are now first-class CMB2 citizens, and registering a box to show on an options page will automatically register the menu page and output the form on the page. [See example](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/blob/v2.2.5/example-functions.php#L640-L683). (The [snippets](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2-Snippet-Library/tree/master/options-and-settings-pages) in the snippet library will be updated to reflect this change)
* Improved Options Page styling. Props [@anhskohbo](https://github.com/anhskohbo) ([#1006](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/1006)).
* Improved cohesive styles for repeatable fields. Props [@anhskohbo](https://github.com/anhskohbo) ([#819](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/819)).
* New field types, `'taxonomy_radio_hierarchical'`, and `'taxonomy_multicheck_hierarchical'`, for displaying taxonomy options in a hierarchial layout. Props to [eriktelepovsky](https://github.com/eriktelepovsky) for the [working code](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/640#issuecomment-246938690). ([#640](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/640))
* Removing last repeat item row (and repeat group row) is now somewhat allowed in that the "remove" button simply resets the last item to empty. Fixes [#312](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/312).
* Enable the additional media library modal filters. Fixes [#873](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/873).
* Sanitize the attributes added via the `cmb2_group_wrap_attributes` filter.
* New field parameter, `'query_args'`, which can be used by the `'taxonomy_*'` fields. Provides ability to override the arguments passed to `get_terms()`.
* The `cmb2_can_save` filter now passes the CMB2 object as the 2nd parameter. Props [@Arno33](https://github.com/Arno33) ([#994](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/994)).
* Update the file field type to work properly within a custom field context by allowing the passing of override arguments to `CMB2_Types::file()` method.
* Many WordPress Code Standards improvements/updates. Props [@bradp](https://github.com/bradp)
* Include absolute paths when including the core php files. Props [@anhskohbo](https://github.com/anhskohbo) ([#998](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/998)).
* Change language throught to reflect CMB2's move to its own organization.
* Break `CMB2_Field:options()` method apart to allow re-setting options from field params. Related: [reaktivstudios/cmb2-flexible-content/pull/8](https://github.com/reaktivstudios/cmb2-flexible-content/pull/8).
* New `CMB2:box_types()` method for getting the array of registered `'object_types'` for a box. Ensures the return is an array.
* Improved inline hooks documentation.
* Updated several CMB2 methods to return the CMB2 object (for method chaining). Methods include: 
	* `CMB2::show_form()`
	* `CMB2::render_form_open()`
	* `CMB2::render_form_close()`
	* `CMB2::render_group_row()`
	* `CMB2::render_hidden_fields()`
	* `CMB2::save_fields()`
	* `CMB2::process_fields()`
	* `CMB2::process_field()`
	* `CMB2::pre_process()`
	* `CMB2::after_save()`
	* `CMB2::add_fields()`

### Bug Fixes

* Update for `file`/`file_list` fields to properly show a preview for SVG images. Fixes [#874](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/874).
* Fix and standardize inconsistent button classes. Update all buttons to use the `.button-secondary` class instead of the `.button` class. This alleviates some front-end issues for themes which target the `.button` class. _This is a backwards-compatibility break._ If your theme or plugin targets the `.button` class within CMB2, you will need to update to use `.button-secondary`.
* Correct the before/after form hooks order. For more details see ([#954](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/954)).
* Fix regression with custom fields not properly repeating. Props [@desrosj](https://github.com/desrosj) ([#969](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/969)). Fixes [#901](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/901).
* Fix "Illegal string offset" notices when `CMB2_Option` methods are called when the option value is empty, as well as additional unit tests for the `CMB2_Option` class. Props [@anhskohbo](https://github.com/anhskohbo) ([#993](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/993)).
* Fix bug where select fields or checkbox fields occasionally would retain previous group's value when adding new groups. Fixes [#853](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/853).
* Fix JS to prevent meta keys with `|` or `/` from breaking file fields. Props [@lipemat](https://github.com/lipemat) ([#1003](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/1003)).
* Fix jQuery Migrate's `jQuery.fn.attr('value', val) no longer sets properties` warning.
* Fix issue with CMB2 being too aggressive with stripping slashes from values. Fixes [#981](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/981).

## [2.2.4 - 2017-02-27](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/releases/tag/v2.2.4)

### Enhancements

* Modify `'taxonomy_*'` fields to return stored terms for non-post objects.
* Modify `CMB2::get_sanitized_values()` to return the sanitized `'taxonomy_*'` field values. Also added `"cmb2_return_taxonomy_values_{$cmb_id}"` filter to modify if `'taxonomy_*'` field values are returned. Fixes [#538](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/538).
* Allow outputting CMB2 boxes/fields in additional locations in the post-editor.

	**The new locations are:** [`form_top`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/edit_form_top/), [`before_permalink`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/edit_form_before_permalink/), [`after_title`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/edit_form_after_title/), and [`after_editor`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/edit_form_after_editor/)

	These would be defined by setting the `context` property for your box:

	```php
	$cmb_demo = new_cmb2_box( array(
		...
		'context' => 'before_permalink',
	) );
	```

	If it is preferred that the fields are output without the metabox, then omit the `'title'` property from the metabox registration array, and instead add `	'remove_box_wrap' => true,`.

	Props [@norcross](https://github.com/norcross) ([#836](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/836)).
* New field parameter, `'render_class'`, allowing you to override the default `'CMB2_Type_Base'` class that is used when rendering the field. This provides interesting object-oriented ways to override default CMB2 behavior by subclassing the default class and overriding methods. The render class can also be overridden with the `"cmb2_render_class_{$fieldtype}"` filter, which is passed the default render class name as well as the `CMB2_Types` object, but this should be used sparingly, and within the context of your project's boxes/fields or you could break other plugins'/themes' CMB2 fields.
* Improvements to the `file`/`file_list` fields javascript APIs, including using undersore templates. 
* Small improvements to the styling for the `file_list` field type.
* New action hook, `cmb2_footer_enqueue`, which occurs after CMB2 enqueues its assets.
* Example functions clean up. Props [@PavelK27](https://github.com/PavelK27) ([#866](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/866)).
* New `CMB2_Utils` methods, `get_available_image_sizes()` and `get_named_size()`. Props [@Cai333](https://github.com/Cai333). 

### Bug Fixes

* Fix datepicker month/year dropdown text color. On windows, the option text was showing as white (invisible). Fixes [#770](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/770).
* Repeatable WYSIWYG no longer breaks if `'quicktags'` param is set to false. Props [@timburden](https://github.com/timburden) ([#797](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/797), [#796](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/796)).
* Do not process title fields during group field save process.
* Fix issue where term-meta values were not being displayed for some users. Props [@sbussetti](https://github.com/sbussetti) ([#763](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/763), [#700](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/700)).
* Fix issue where term meta would not be applied when using the new term form if multiple object types were specified. Props [@ADC07](https://github.com/ADC07) ([#842](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/842), [#841](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/841)).
* Fix WordPress spinner styling when boxes/fields used on the frontend.
* Fix issue where clicking to remove a `file_list` item could occasionally remove the field row. ([#828](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/828)).
* Fix issue where empty file field in group would still cause non-empty values to store to database. ([#721](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/721)).
* Make `file`/`file_list` field preview images work with named sizes. Props [@Cai333](https://github.com/Cai333) ([#848](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/848), [#844](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/844)).
* Fix incorrect text-domain. ([#798](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/798))
* Do not silence notices/errors in `CMB2_Utils::get_file_ext()`.
* If `title` field type has no name value, then only output a span element (instead of a header element).

## [2.2.3.1 - 2016-11-08](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/releases/tag/v2.2.3.1)

### Enhancements

* Better styling for disabled group "X" buttons, and add title attr. Fixes [#773](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/773).

### Bug Fixes

* Use quotes for `label[for=""]` selector. Fixed `Syntax error, unrecognized expression`. Props [@anhskohbo](https://github.com/anhskohbo) ([#789](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/789)).
* Fix `ReferenceError: tinyMCE is not defined` javascript errors (happening when trying to remove a repeatable field/group). Fixes [#790](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/790), and [#730](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/730).
* Fix REST API `'show_in_rest'` examples in `example-functions.php`. Any REST API boxes/fields must use the `'cmb2_init'` hook (as opposed to the `'cmb2_admin_init'` hook).

## [2.2.3 - 2016-10-25](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/releases/tag/v2.2.3)

### Enhancements

* CMB2 REST API! CMB2 now has WP REST API endpoints for displaying your boxes and fields data, as well as registers rest fields in the existing post, user, term, and comment endpoints (in the cmb2 namespace). Enabling the REST API for your boxes/fields is opt-in, meaning it will not be automatically enabled. For more info, [check out the wiki](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/wiki/REST-API).
* Small string improvement, move a period inside the translatable string. Props [@pedro-mendonca](https://github.com/pedro-mendonca) ([#672](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/672)).
* Introduce the `'save_field'` boolean field parameter for disabling the saving of a field. Useful if you want to display the value of another field, or use a disabled/read-only field. Props [@jamesgol](https://github.com/jamesgol) ([#674](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/674), [#346](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/346), [#500](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/500)).
* Update docblocks for `CMB2_Field::save_field_from_data()` and `CMB2_Field::save_field()`. Props [@jamesgol](https://github.com/jamesgol) ([#675](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/675)).
* More javascript events tied to the media modal actions (related to the `'file'` and '`file_list'` fields). `'cmb_media_modal_init'`, `'cmb_media_modal_open'`, and `'cmb_media_modal_select'`.
* All CMB2 JS events now also get the CMB2 JS object passed in the list of arguments.
* CMB2 JS object is now instantiated without stomping existing object, to enable extending.
* New field parameter for taxonomy fields, `'remove_default'` which allows disabling the default taxonomy metabox. Props [@c3mdigital](https://github.com/c3mdigital) ([#593](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/593)).
* Change `'row_classes'` to just `'classes'`, to mirror the metabox `'classes'` property. Also now accepts a `'classes_cb'` parameter for specifying a callback which returns a string or array. The callback will receive `$field_args` as the first argument, and the CMB2_Field `$field` object as the second argument. (`'row_classes'` will continue to work, but is deprecated)
* Make wysiwyg editors work in the repeatable groups context. A standard repeatable (non-group) wysiwyg field is not supported (but will possibly be included in a future update). Props [@johnsonpaul1014](https://github.com/johnsonpaul1014) ([#26](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/26), [#99](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/99), [#260](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/260), [#264](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/264), [#356](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/356), [#431](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/431), [#462](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/462), [#657](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/657), [#693](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/693)). 
* Add an id to the heading tag in the title field. This allows linking to a particular title using the id.
* Internationalization improvements. Props [ramiy](https://github.com/ramiy) ([#696](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/696)).
* Ensure that saving does not happen during a switch-to-blog session, as data would be saved to the wrong object. [See more](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/bug-in-lastest-version?replies=2).
* Add `'cmb2_group_wrap_attributes'` filter to modifying the group wrap div's attributes. Filter gets passed an array of attributes and expects the return to be an array. Props [jrfnl](https://github.com/jrfnl) ([#582](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/582)).
* Update the unit-tests README and inline docs. Props [bobbingwide](https://github.com/bobbingwide) ([#714](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/714), [#715](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/715)).
* Minor update to make naming-conventions consistent. Props [ramiy](https://github.com/ramiy) ([#718](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/718)).
* Update files to be compatible with PHP7 CodeSniffer standards. Props [ryanshoover](https://github.com/ryanshoover) ([#719](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/719), [#720](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/720)).
* Make exception message translatable. Props [ramiy](https://github.com/ramiy) ([#724](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/724)).
* Portuguese translation provided by [@alvarogois](https://github.com/alvarogois) and [@pedro-mendonca](https://github.com/pedro-mendonca) - [#709](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/709), [#727](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/727).
* Stop using `$wp_version` global. Props [ramiy](https://github.com/ramiy) ([#731](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/731)).
* Closures (anonymous functions) are now supported for any box/field `'*_cb'` parameters. E.g.
```php
	...
	'show_on_cb' => function( $cmb ) { return has_tag( 'cats', $cmb->object_id ); },
	...
```

### Bug Fixes

* If custom field types use a method and the Type object has not been instantiated, Try to guess the Type object and instantiate.
* Normalize WordPress root path (`ABSPATH`) and theme rooth path (`get_theme_root()`). Props [@rianbotha](https://github.com/rianbotha) ([#677](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/677), [#676](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/676)).
* Fix issue with `'cmb2_remove_row'` Javascript callback for non-group row removal. Fixes [#729](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/729)).
* Fix issue with missing assignment of variable (undefined variable). Props [@anhskohbo](https://github.com/anhskohbo) ([#779](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/779)).

## 2.2.2.1 - 2016-06-27

### Bug Fixes

* Fix issue that kept CMB2 stylesheet from being enqueued when using the [options-page snippets](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2-Snippet-Library/tree/master/options-and-settings-pages).
* Fix issue which caused the CMB2 column display styles to be enqueued in the wrong pages. Now only enqueues on admin pages with columns.

## 2.2.2 - 2016-06-27

### Enhancements

* You can now set admin post-listing columns with an extra field parameter, `'column' => true,`. If you want to dictate what position the column is, use `'column' => array( 'position' => 2 ),`. If you want to dictate the column title (instead of using the field `'name'` value), use `'column' => array( 'name' => 'My Column' ),`. If you need to specify the column display callback, set the `'display_cb'` parameter to [a callback function](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/wiki/Field-Parameters#render_row_cb). Columns work for post (all post-types), comment, user, and term object types.
* Updated Datepicker styles using JJJ's "jQuery UI Datepicker CSS for WordPress", so props Props [@stuttter](https://github.com/stuttter), [@johnjamesjacoby](https://github.com/johnjamesjacoby). Also cleaned up the timepicker styles (specifically the buttons) to more closely align with the datepicker and WordPress styles.
* CMB2 is now a lot more intelligent about where it is located in your installation. This update should solve almost all of the reasons to use the `'cmb2_meta_box_url'` filter (thought it will continue to work as expected). ([#27](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/27), [#118](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/118), [#432](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/432), [related wiki item](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/wiki/Troubleshooting#cmb2-urls-issues))
* Implement CMB2_Ajax as a singleton. Props [jrfnl](https://github.com/jrfnl) ([#602](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/602)).
* Add `classes` and `classes_cb` CMB2 box params which allows you to add additional classes to the cmb-wrap. The `classes` parameter can take a string or array, and the `classes_cb` takes a callback which returns a string or array. The callback will receive `$cmb` as an argument. These classes are also passed through a new filter, `'cmb2_wrap_classes'`, which receives the array of classes as the first argument, and the CMB2 object as the second. Reported/requested in [#364](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/364#issuecomment-213223692).
* Make the `'title'` field type accept extra arguments. Props [@vladolaru](https://github.com/vladolaru), [@pixelgrade](https://github.com/pixelgrade) ([#656](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/656)).
* Updated `cmb2_get_oembed()` function to NOT return the "remove" link, as it's intended for outputting the oembed only. **This is a backwards-compatibility concern.** If you were depending on the "remove" link, use `cmb2_ajax()->get_oembed( $args )` instead.
* New function, `cmb2_do_oembed()`', which is hooked to `'cmb2_do_oembed'`, so you can use `do_action( 'cmb2_do_oembed', $args )` in your themes without `function_exists()` checks.
* New method, `CMB2:set_prop( $property, $value )`, for setting a CMB2 metabox object property.
* The `CMB2_Field` object instances will now have a `cmb_id` property and a `get_cmb` method to enable access to the field's `CMB2` parent object's instance, in places like field callbacks and filters (e.g. `$cmb = $field->get_cmb();`).
* Add a `data-fieldtype` attribute to the field rows for simpler identification in Javascript.
* Moved each type in `CMB2_Types` to it's own class so that each field type can handle it's own field display, and added the infrastructure to maintainn back-compatibility.
* New `CMB2_Utils` methods, `notempty()` and `filter_empty()`, both of which consider `null`, `''` and `false` as empty, but allow `0` (for saving `0` as a field value).
* New `CMB2_Utils` public methods, `get_url_from_dir()`, `get_file_ext()`, `get_file_name_from_path()`, and `wp_at_least()`.
* Add a `cmb_pre_init` Javascript event to allow overriding CMB2 defaults via JS.

### Bug Fixes
* Fix issue with 'default' callback not being applied in all instances. Introduced new `CMB2_Field::get_default()` method, and `'default_cb'` field parameter. Using the `'default'` field parameter with a callback will be deprecated in the next few releases. ([#572](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/572)).
* Be sure to call `CMB2_Field::row_classes()` for group field rows. Also, update CSS to use the "cmb-type-group" classname instead of "cmb-repeat-group-wrap".
* Introduce new `'text'` and `'text_cb'` field parameters for overriding CMB2 text strings instead of using the `'options'` array. ([#630](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/630))
* Fix bug where the value of '0' could not be saved in group fields.
* Fix bug where a serialized empty array value in the database for a repeatable field would output as "Array".
* Allow for optional/empty money field. Props [@jrfnl](https://github.com/jrfnl) ([#577](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/577)).
* The `CMB2::$updated` parameter (which contains field ids for all fields updated during a save) now also correctly adds group field ids to the array.

## 2.2.1 - 2016-02-29

### Bug Fixes

* Fixes back-compatibility issue which could allow multiple CMB2 instances to load (causing fatal errors). ([#520](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/520))

## 2.2.0 - 2016-02-27

### Enhancements

* Term Meta! As of WordPress 4.4, [WordPress will have the ability to use term metadata](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/23/4-4-taxonomy-roundup/). CMB2 will work with term meta out of the box. To do so, see the example cmb registration in the `yourprefix_register_taxonomy_metabox` function in [example-functions.php](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/blob/master/example-functions.php).
* New hooks which hook in after save field action: `'cmb2_save_field'` and `"cmb2_save_field_{$field_id}"`. Props [wpsmith](https://github.com/wpsmith) ([#475](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/475)).
* The "cmb2_sanitize_{$field_type}" hook now runs for every field type (not just custom types) so you can override the sanitization for all field types via a filter.
* `CMB2::show_form()` is now composed of 3 smaller methods, `CMB2::render_form_open()`, `CMB2::render_field()`, `CMB2::render_form_close()` ([#506](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/506)).
* RTL Style generated. Props [@devinsays](https://github.com/devinsays) ([#510](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/510)).
* Properly scope date/time-pickers styling by adding a class to only cmb2 picker instances. ([#527](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/527))
* Allow per-field overrides for the date/time/color picker options (wiki documentation: [Modify Field Date, Time, or Color Picker options](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/wiki/Tips-&-Tricks#modify-field-date-time-or-color-picker-options))
* Fix some inline documentation issues. Props [@jrfnl](https://github.com/jrfnl) ([#579](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/579)).
* Include `.gitattributes` file for excluding development resources when using Composer. Props [@benoitchantre](https://github.com/benoitchantre) ([#575](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/575), [#53](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/53)).

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue with `'taxonomy_select'` field type where a term which evaluated falsey would not be displayed properly. Props [adamcapriola](https://github.com/adamcapriola) ([#477](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/477)).
* Fix issue with colorpickers not changing when sorting groups.
* `'show_option_none'` field parameter now works on taxonomy fields when explicitly setting to false.
* Fix so the date/time-picker javascript respects the `'date_format'` and `'time_format'` field parameters. Props [@yivi](https://github.com/yivi) ([#39](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/39), [#282](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/282), [#300](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/300), [#318](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/318), [#330](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/330), [#446](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/446), [#498](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/498)).
* Fix a sometimes-broken unit test. Props [JPry](https://github.com/JPry) ([#539](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/539)).
* Fix issue with oembed fields not working correctly on options pages. ([#542](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/542)).
* Fix issue with repeatable field <button> elements stealing focus from "submit" button.

## 2.1.2 - 2015-10-01

### Bug Fixes

* Fixes back-compatibility issue when adding fields array to the metabox registration. ([#472](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/472))

## 2.1.1 - 2015-09-30

### Enhancements

* Make all CMB2::save_fields arguments optional to fall-back to `$_POST` data. Props [JPry](https://github.com/JPry).
* New filter, `cmb2_non_repeatable_fields` for adding additional fields to the blacklist of repeatable field-types. Props [JPry](https://github.com/JPry) ([#430](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/430)).
* New recommended hook for adding metaboxes, `cmb2_admin_init`. Most metabox registration only needs to happen if in wp-admin, so there is no reason to register them when loading the front-end (and increase the memory usage). `cmb2_init` still exists to register metaboxes that will be used on the front-end or used on both the front and back-end. Instances of `cmb2_init` in example-functions.php have been switched to `cmb2_admin_init`.
* Add `'render_row_cb'` field parameter for overriding the field render method.
* Add `'label_cb'` field parameter for overriding the field label render method.
* Allow `CMB2_Types::checkbox()` method to be more flexible for extending by taking an args array and an `$is_checked` second argument.
* More thorough unit tests. Props [pglewis](https://github.com/pglewis), ([#447](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/447),[#448](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/448)).
* Update `CMB2_Utils::image_id_from_url` to be more reliable. Props [wpscholar](https://github.com/wpscholar), ([#453](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/453)).
* `cmb2_get_option` now takes a default fallback value as a third parameter.

### Bug Fixes

* Address issue where `'file'` and `'file_list'` field results were getting mixed. Props [augustuswm](https://github.com/augustuswm) ([#382](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/382), [#250](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/250), [#296](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/296)).
* Fix long-standing issues with radio and multicheck fields in repeatable groups losing their values when new rows are added. ([#341](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/341), [#304](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/304), [#263](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/263), [#246](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/246), [#150](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/150))
* Fixes issue where currently logged-in user's profile data would display in the "Add New User" screen fields. ([#427](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/427))
* Fixes issue where radio values/selections would not always properly transfer when shifting rows (up/down). Props [jamiechong](https://github.com/jamiechong) ([#429](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/429), [#152](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/152)).
* Fixes issue where repeatable groups display "Array" as the field values if group is left completely empty. ([#332](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/332),[#390](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/390)).
* Fixes issue with `'file_list'` fields not saving properly when in repeatable groups display. Props [jamiechong](https://github.com/jamiechong) ([#433](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/433),[#187](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/187)).
* Update `'taxonomy_radio_inline'` and `'taxonomy_multicheck_inline'` fields sanitization method to use the same method as the non-inline versions. Props [superfreund](https://github.com/superfreund) ([#454](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/454)).

## 2.1.0 - 2015-08-05

### Bug Fixes

* Fix user fields not saving. Props [achavez](https://github.com/achavez), ([#417](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/417)).

## 2.0.9 - 2015-07-28

### Enhancements

* Updated/Added many translations. Props [fxbenard](https://github.com/fxbenard), ([#203](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/344)) and [Mte90](https://github.com/Mte90) for the Italian translation.
* Updated `'file_list'` field type to have a more intuitive selection in the media library, and updated the 'Use file' text in the button. Props [SteveHoneyNZ](https://github.com/SteveHoneyNZ) ([#357](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/357), [#358](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/358)).
* `'closed'` group field option parameter introduced in order to set the groups as collapsed by default. Requested in [#391](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/391).
* Added `"cmb2_{$object_type}_process_fields_{$cmb_id}"` hook for hooking in and modifying the metabox or fields before the fields are processed/sanitized for saving.
* Added Comment Metabox support. Props [GregLancaster71](https://github.com/GregLancaster71) ([#238](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/238), [#244](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/244)).
* New `"cmb2_{$field_id}_is_valid_img_ext"`` filter for determining if a field value has a valid image file-type extension.

### Bug Fixes

* `'multicheck_inline'`, `'taxonomy_radio_inline'`, and `'taxonomy_multicheck_inline'` field types were not outputting anything since it's value was not being returned. Props [ediamin](https://github.com/ediamin), ([#367](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/367), ([#405](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/405)).
* `'hidden'` type fields were not honoring the `'show_on_cb'` callback. Props [JPry](https://github.com/JPry), ([commits](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/compare/5a4146eec546089fbe1a1c859d680dfda3a86ee2...1ef5ef1e3b2260ab381090c4abe9dc7234cfa0a6)).
* Fixed: There was no minified cmb2-front.min.css file.
* Fallback for fatal error with invalid timezone. Props [ryanduff](https://github.com/ryanduff) ([#385](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/385)).
* Fix issues with deleting a row from repeatable group. Props [yuks](https://github.com/yuks) ([#387](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/387)).
* Ensure value passed to `strtotime` in `make_valid_time_stamp` is cast to a string. Props [vajrasar](https://github.com/vajrasar) ([#389](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/389)).
* Fixed issue with Windows IIS and bundling CMB2 in the theme. Props [DevinWalker](https://github.com/DevinWalker), ([#400](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/400), [#401](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/401))

## 2.0.8 - 2015-06-01

### Bug Fixes

* Fix color-picker field not enqueueing the colorpicker script. ([#333](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/333))

## 2.0.7 - 2015-05-28

### Enhancements

* Ability to use non-repeatable group fields by setting the `'repeatable'` field param to `false` when registering a group field type. Props [marcusbattle](https://github.com/marcusbattle), ([#159](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/159)).
* Add and enqeueue a front-end specific CSS file which adds additional styles which are typically covered by wp-admin css. ([#311](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/311))
* Better handling of the CMB2 javascript (and CSS) required dependencies array. Dependencies are now only added conditionally based on the field types that are actually visible. ([#136](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/136))
* **THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE:** The `group` field type's `'show_on_cb'` parameter now receives the `CMB2_Field` object instance as an argument instead of the `CMB2` instance. If you're using the `'show_on_cb'` parameter for a `group` field, please adjust accordingly. _note: you can still retrieve the `CMB2` instance via the `cmb2_get_metabox` helper function._
* New dynamic hook, `"cmb2_save_{$object_type}_fields_{$this->cmb_id}"`, to complement the existing `"cmb2_save_{$object_type}_fields"` hook.
* New CMB2 parameter, `enqueue_js`, to disable the enqueueing of the CMB2 Javascript.
* German translation provided by Friedhelm Jost.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix incorrect repeatable group title number. ([#310](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/310))
* Fix obscure bug which prevented group field arguments from being passed to the sub-fields (like `show_names` and `context`).
* Fixed occasional issue when adding a group row, the previous row's content would be cloned. ([#257](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/257))

## 2.0.6 - 2015-04-30

### Enhancements

* New metabox/form parameter, `show_on_cb`, allows you to conditionally display a cmb metabox/form via a callback. The `$cmb` object gets passed as a parameter to the callback. This complements the `'show_on_cb'` parameter that already exists for individual fields. Using this callback is similar to using the `'cmb2_show_on'` filter, but only applies to that specific metabox and it is recommended to use this callback instead as it minimizes th risk that your filter will affect other metaboxes.
* Taxonomy types no longer save a value. The value getting saved was causing confusion and is not meant to be used. To use the saved taxonomy data, you need to use the WordPress term api, `get_the_terms `, `get_the_term_list`, etc.
* Add `'multiple'` field parameter to store values in individual rows instead of serialized array. Will only work if field is not repeatable or a repeatable group. Props [JohnyGoerend](https://github.com/JohnyGoerend). ([#262](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/262), [#206](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/206), [#45](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/45)).
* Portuguese (Brazil) translation provided by [@lucascdsilva](https://github.com/lucascdsilva) - [#293](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/293).
* Spanish (Spain) translation updated by [@yivi](https://github.com/yivi) - [#272](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/272).
* Added group field callback parameters, `'before_group'`, `'before_group_row'`, `'after_group_row'`, `'after_group'` to complement the `'before_row'`, `'before'`, `'after'`, `'after_row'` field parameters.
* Better styling for `title` fields and `title` descriptions on options pages.
* Add a `sanitization_cb` field parameter check for the `group` field type.
* Better function/file doc-blocks to provide better documentation for automated documentation tools. See: [cmb2.io/api](http://cmb2.io/api/).
* `cmb2_print_metabox_form`, `cmb2_metabox_form`, and `cmb2_get_metabox_form` helper functions now accept two new parameters:
	* an `'object_type'` parameter to explictly set that in the `$cmb` object.
	* an `'enqueue_js'` parameter to explicitly disable the CMB JS enqueue. This is handy if you're not planning on using any of the fields which require JS (like color/date pickers, wysiwyg, file, etc).

### Bug Fixes

* Fix issue with oembed fields in repeatable groups where changing video changed it for all fields in a group.
* Fix empty arrays (like in the group field) saving as a value.
* Move `'cmb2_override_meta_value'` and `"cmb2_override_{$field_id}_meta_value"` filters to the `CMB2_Field::get_data()` method so that the filters are applied every time the data is requested. **THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE:** The parameters for those filters have changed a bit. Previously, the filters accepted 5 arguments, `$value`, `$object_id`, `$field_args`, `$object_type`, `$field`. They have changed to accept 4 arguments instead, `$value`, `$object_id`, `$args`, `$field`, where `$args` is an array that contains the following:
	* @type string $type     The current object type
	* @type int    $id       The current object ID
	* @type string $field_id The ID of the field being requested
	* @type bool   $repeat   Whether current field is repeatable
	* @type bool   $single   Whether current field is a single database row


## 2.0.5 - 2015-03-17

### Bug Fixes

* Fix grouped fields display (first field was being repeated), broken in 2.0.3.

## 2.0.4 - 2015-03-16

### Enhancements

* `select`, `radio`, `radio_inline` field types now all accept the `'show_option_none'` field parameter. This parameter allows you to set the text to display for showing a 'no selection' option. Default will be `false`, which means a 'none' option will not be added. Set to `true` to use the default text, 'None', or specify another value, i.e. 'No selection'.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix back-compatibility when adding group field sub-fields via old array method (vs using the `CMB2:add_group_field()` method). Thanks to [norcross](https://github.com/norcross) for reporting.
* Fix occasional jQuery issues with group-field indexes.

## 2.0.3 - 2015-03-15

### Enhancements

* New constant, `CMB2_DIR`, which stores the file-path to the CMB2 directory.
* `text_date`, `text_time`, `text_date_timestamp`, `text_datetime_timestamp`, and ` text_datetime_timestamp_timezone` field types now take an arguments array so they can be extended by custom field types.
* Removed auto-scroll when adding groups. To re-add the feature, use the [snippet/plugin here](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2-Snippet-Library/blob/master/javascript/cmb2-auto-scroll-to-new-group.php). ([#205](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/205))
* Updated Timepicker utilizing the [@trentrichardson](https://github.com/trentrichardson) jQuery Timepicker add-on (https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Timepicker-Addon), and updated Datepicker styles. Props [JonMasterson](https://github.com/JonMasterson). ([#204](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/204), [#206](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/206), [#45](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/45)).
* Added a callback option for the field default value. The callback gets passed an array of all the field parameters as the first argument, and the field object as the second argument. (which means you can get the post id using `$field->object_id`). ([#233](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/233)).
* New `CMB2::get_field()` method and `cmb2_get_field` helper function for retrieving a `CMB2_Field` object from the array of registered fields for a metabox.
* New `CMB2::get_sanitized_values()` method and `cmb2_get_metabox_sanitized_values` helper function for retrieving sanitized values from an array of values (usually `$_POST` data).
* New `'save_fields'` metabox parameter that can be used to disable (by setting `'save_fields' => false`) the automatic saving of the fields when the form is submitted. These can be useful when you want to handle the saving of the fields yourself, or want to use submitted data for other purposes like generating new posts, or sending emails, etc.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix commented out text_datetime_timestamp_timezone field registration example in `example-functions.php`. Props [cliffordp](https://github.com/cliffordp), ([#203](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/203)).
* Fix sidebar styling for money fields and fields with textareas. ([#234](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/234))
* Fix `CMB2_Sanitize` class to properly use the stripslashed value (which was added in [#162](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/162) but never used). Props [dustyf](https://github.com/dustyf), ([#241](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/241)).

## 2.0.2 - 2015-02-15

### Enhancements

* Use the more appropriate `add_meta_boxes` hook for hooking in metaboxes to post-edit screen. Thanks [@inspiraaz](https://github.com/inspiraaz) for reporting. ([#161](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/161))
* Add a `row_classes` field param which allows you to add additional classes to the cmb-row wrap. This parameter can take a string, or array, or can take a callback that returns a string or array. The callback will receive `$field_args` as the first argument, and the CMB2_Field `$field` object as the second argument. Reported/requested in [#68](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/issues/68).
* New constant, `CMB2_LOADED`, which you can use to check if CMB2 is loaded for your plugins/themes with CMB2 dependency.
* New hooks, [`cmb2_init_before_hookup` and `cmb2_after_init`](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2-Snippet-Library/blob/master/filters-and-actions).
* New API for adding metaboxes and fields, demonstrated in [`example-functions.php`](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/blob/master/example-functions.php). In keeping with backwards-compatibility, the `cmb2_meta_boxes` filter method will still work, but is not recommended. New API includes `new_cmb2_box` helper function to generate a new metabox, and returns a `$cmb` object to add new fields (via the `CMB2::add_field()` and `CMB2::add_group_field()` methods).
* New CMB2 method, [`CMB2::remove_field()`](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2-Snippet-Library/blob/master/filters-and-actions/cmb2_init_%24cmb_id-remove-field.php).
* New CMB2_Boxes method, [`CMB2_Boxes::remove()`](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2-Snippet-Library/blob/master/filters-and-actions/cmb2_init_before_hookup-remove-cmb2-metabox.php).
* When clicking on a file/image in the `file`, or `file_list` type, the media modal will open with that image selected. Props [johnsonpaul1014](https://github.com/johnsonpaul1014), ([#120](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/pull/120)).


## 2.0.1 - 2015-02-02

2.0.1 is the official version after beta, and includes all the changes from 2.0.0 (beta).

## 2.0.0(beta) - 2014-08-16

2.0.0 is the official version number for the transition to CMB2, and 2.0.1 is the official version after beta. It is a complete rewrite. Improvements and fixes are listed below. __Note: This release requires WordPress 3.8+__
 
### Enhancements

* Converted `<table>` markup to more generic `<div>` markup to be more extensible and allow easier styling.
* Much better handling and display of repeatable groups.

### Bug Fixes

* Radio button values were not showing saved value. ([#500](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress/issues/500))

## 1.1.0 - 2014-04-02

### Enhancements

* [Repeatable groups](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/wiki/Field-Types#group)
* Support for more fields to be repeatable, including oEmbed field, and date, time, and color picker fields, etc.
* Codebase has been revamped to be more modular and object-oriented. 
* New filter, `"cmb_{$element}_attributes"	` for modifying an element's attributes.
* Every field now supports an `attributes` parameter that takes an array of attributes. [Read more](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/wiki/Field-Types#attributes).

* Better handling of labels in sidebar. They are now placed on top of the input rather than adjacent.

## 1.0.2 - 2014-03-03

### Enhancements

* Change the way the `'cmb_validate_{$field['type']}'` filter works.
It is now passed a null value vs saved value. If null is returned, default sanitization will follow. **THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE**. If you're already using this filter, take note.
* All field types that take an option array have been simplified to take `key => value` pairs (vs `array( 'name' => 'value', 'value' => 'key', )`). This effects the 'select', 'radio', 'radio_inline' field types. The 'multicheck' field type was already using the `key => value` format. Backwards compatibility has been maintained for those using the older style.
* Added default value option for `taxonomy_select` field type. props [@darlantc](https://github.com/darlantc), ([#473](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress/pull/473))

* Use `get_the_terms` where possible since the data is cached.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed wysiwyg escaping slashes. props [@gregrickaby](https://github.com/gregrickaby), ([#465](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress/pull/465))

* Fix undeclared JS variable. [@veelen](https://github.com/veelen), ([#451](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress/pull/451))
* Fix `file_list` errors when removing all files and saving.
* Set correct `object_id` to be used later in `cmb_show_on` filter. [@lauravaq](https://github.com/lauravaq), ([#445](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress/pull/445))
* Fix sanitization recursion memeory issues.

## 1.0.1 - 2014-01-24

* two filters to override the setting and getting of options, `cmb_override_option_get_$option_key` and `cmb_override_option_save_$option_key` respectively.

* Improved styling on taxonomy (\*tease\*) and options pages and for new 3.8 admin UI.
* New sanitization class to sanitize data when saved.
* New callback field parameter, `sanitization_cb`, for performing your own sanitization.
* new `cmb_Meta_Box_types::esc()` method that handles escaping data for display.
* New callback field parameter, `escape_cb`, for performing your own data escaping, as well as a new filter, `'cmb_types_esc_'. $field['type']`.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed wysiwyg editor button padding. props [@corvannoorloos](https://github.com/corvannoorloos), ([#391](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress/pull/391))
* A few php < 5.3 errors were addressed.
* Fields with quotation marks no longer break the input/textarea fields.
* metaboxes for Attachment pages now save correctly. Thanks [@nciske](https://github.com/nciske) for reporting. ([#412](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress/issues/412))
* Occasionally fields wouldn't save because of the admin show_on filter.
