## Description

CMB2 is a metabox, custom fields, and forms library for WordPress that will blow your mind.

**[Plugin available on wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/)**

CMB2 is a complete rewrite of [Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress). To get started, please follow the examples in the included `example-functions.php` file and have a look at the [basic usage instructions](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Basic-Usage).

You can see a list of available field types [here](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Field-Types#types).

## Features:

* Create metaboxes to be used on post edit screens.
* [Create forms to be used on an options pages](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Using-CMB-to-create-an-Admin-Theme-Options-Page).
* Create forms to handle user meta and display them on user profile add/edit pages.
* [Flexible API that allows you to use CMB forms almost anywhere, even on the front-end](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Bringing-Metaboxes-to-the-Front-end).
* [Several field types are included](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Field-Types).
* [Custom API hook that allows you to create your own field types](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Adding-your-own-field-types).
* There are numerous hooks and filters, allowing you to modify many aspects of the library (without editing it directly).
* Repeatable fields for most field types are supported, as well as repeatable field groups.
* CMB2 is safe to bundle with any project. It will only load the newest version in the system.

## Translation
* Thanks to many in the CMB2 community and to our friends at [wp-translations.org](http://wp-translations.org/project/cmb2/), we have a good start on several translations for CMB2. Please feel free to [work with wp-translations.org](http://wp-translations.org/project/cmb2/) to provide even more!

## 3rd Party Resources

#### Custom Field Types
* [CMB2 Field Type: CMB Attached Posts Field](https://github.com/coreymcollins/cmb-attached-posts) from [coreymcollins](https://github.com/coreymcollins): `custom_attached_posts`, for attaching posts to a page.
* [CMB2 Field Type: CMB2 Post Search field](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2-Post-Search-field): `post_search_text` adds a post-search dialog for searching/attaching other post IDs.
* [CMB2 Field Type: CMB2 RGBa Colorpicker](https://github.com/JayWood/CMB2_RGBa_Picker) from [JayWood](https://github.com/JayWood): `rgba_colorpicker ` adds a color picker that supports RGBa, (RGB with transparency (alpha) value).
* [CMB2 Field Type: Google Maps](https://github.com/mustardBees/cmb_field_map) from [mustardBees](https://github.com/mustardBees): Custom field type for Google Maps.
	> The `pw_map` field stores the latitude/longitude values which you can then use to display a map in your theme.

* [CMB2 Field Type: Select2](https://github.com/mustardBees/cmb-field-select2) from [mustardBees](https://github.com/mustardBees): Custom field types which use the [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/) script:

	> 1. The `pw_select field` acts much like the default select field. However, it adds typeahead-style search allowing you to quickly make a selection from a large list
	> 2. The `pw_multiselect` field allows you to select multiple values with typeahead-style search. The values can be dragged and dropped to reorder

## Installation

If installing the plugin from wordpress.org:

1. Upload the entire `/CMB2` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate CMB2 through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
2. Copy (and rename if desired) `example-functions.php` into to your theme or plugin's directory.
2. Edit to only include the fields you need and rename the functions.
4. Profit.

If including the library in your plugin or theme:

1. Place the CMB2 directory inside of your theme or plugin.
2. Copy (and rename if desired) `example-functions.php` into a folder *above* the CMB2 directory OR copy the entirety of its contents to your theme's `functions.php` file.
2. Edit to only include the fields you need and rename the functions (CMB2 directory should be left unedited in order to easily update the library).
4. Profit.

## Most Recent Changes - 2.0.4, 2.0.5

#### 2.0.5 - 2015-03-17

##### Bug Fixes

* Fix grouped fields display (first field was being repeated), broken in 2.0.3.

#### 2.0.4 - 2015-03-16

##### Enhancements

* `select`, `radio`, `radio_inline` field types now all accept the `'show_option_none'` field parameter. This parameter allows you to set the text to display for showing a 'no selection' option. Default will be `false`, which means a 'none' option will not be added. Set to `true` to use the default text, 'None', or specify another value, i.e. 'No selection'.

##### Bug Fixes

* Fix back-compatibility when adding group field sub-fields via old array method (vs using the `CMB2:add_group_field()` method). Thanks to [norcross](https://github.com/norcross) for reporting.
* Fix occasional jQuery issues with group-field indexes.

## Known Issues

* The CMB2 url (for css/js resources) does not define properly in all WAMP/XAMP (Windows) environments.
* Metabox containing WYSIWYG editor cannot be moved or used in a repeatable way at this time (this is a TinyMCE issue).
* Not all fields work well in a repeatable group.
