## Description

CMB2 is a developer's toolkit for building metaboxes, custom fields, and forms for WordPress that will blow your mind.

**[Download plugin on wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/)**

CMB2 is a complete rewrite of [Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress). To get started, please follow the examples in the included `example-functions.php` file and have a look at the [basic usage instructions](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Basic-Usage).

You can see a list of available field types [here](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Field-Types#types).

## Features:

* Create metaboxes to be used on post edit screens.
* [Create forms to be used on an options pages](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Using-CMB-to-create-an-Admin-Theme-Options-Page).
* Create forms to handle user meta and display them on user profile add/edit pages.
* [Flexible API that allows you to use CMB forms almost anywhere, even on the front-end](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Bringing-Metaboxes-to-the-Front-end).
* [Several field types are included](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Field-Types).
* [Custom API hook that allows you to create your own field types](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Adding-your-own-field-types).
* There are numerous hooks and filters, allowing you to modify many aspects of the library (without editing it directly).
* Repeatable fields for most field types are supported, as well as repeatable field groups.
* CMB2 is safe to bundle with any project. It will only load the newest version in the system.

## Translation
* Thanks to many in the CMB2 community and to our friends at [wp-translations.org](http://wp-translations.org/project/cmb2/), we have a good start on several translations for CMB2. Please feel free to [work with wp-translations.org](http://wp-translations.org/project/cmb2/) to provide even more!
